# Neural Lattice Architecture

Fractal-rooted knowledge base system designed as a seed library for AI-assisted development.

Key features:
- Graph-structured folder hierarchy mirroring algorithmic classics (CLRS patterns)
- Self-similar branching for infinite scalability
- Built to serve as retrievable context for LLM agents (Cursor, Copilot, Grok Code Fast)
- Enables rapid full-stack orchestration with minimal token overhead

Tech: Directory structure + Markdown/PDF seeding + RAG-ready design

# Archivist Framework

Intelligent project scaffolding and documentation preservation system.

Core capabilities:
- Auto-generates clean, fractal folder structures for backend/frontend/API layers
- Maintains living architecture docs, decision logs, and knowledge_library branches
- Designed for zero-friction handoff to AI coding agents
- Supports recursive bloom cycles for iterative builds
- # VBR Studios - Markdown Deferred

Deferred-rendering markdown studio prototype for dynamic documentation.

Highlights:
- Loads entire knowledge base on startup (books, algorithms, code snippets)
- Enables real-time AI collaboration within VS Code / Codespaces environments
- Markdown-first workflow with deferred complexity for clean readability
- Bridges human orchestration and LLM execution

Tech: Markdown + YAML configs + VS Code workspace integration

Proof-of-concept for next-gen AI dev studios.


Tech: Python scripting + Markdown standards + GitHub Actions ready

Foundation for production-grade AI-orchestrated apps.
